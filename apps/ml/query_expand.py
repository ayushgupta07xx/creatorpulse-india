"""Stage-0 brief query-expansion + results explainer for the match engine.

expand_brief(): Groq disambiguates a short/polysemous brand brief toward the
creator-economy sense ("roasting" -> comedy roast, not cooking) and appends
concrete creator-content phrases, so BGE-small embeds it richly. It is ADDITIVE
(original brief is preserved) and NO-OPS to the raw brief when GROQ_API_KEY is
unset or the call fails/times out -- offline + CI stay green, a match never
blocks on the LLM. Reuses Groq via requests (no new dependency). (ADR-0026)

explain_results(): deterministic "why no/few results" from the match funnel
counts -- a reviewer-trustable diagnostic, not an LLM guess.
