"""Faithfulness eval for the CreatorPulse grounded assistant.

Runs each golden case (evaluation/faithfulness_cases.yaml) through the REAL
groq_chat() tool-calling loop, capturing the tool calls/results that grounded
the answer. An LLM judge (GROQ_JUDGE_MODEL, default llama-3.1-8b-instant) then
scores each reply for faithfulness to that tool output: does every number/claim
trace to a tool result or the assistant's allowed framing, with nothing invented?

Non-invasive: wraps the real _chat_tool_executor to tee (name, args, result) per
case — no change to apps/api or apps/ml.

Resumable: appends each scored case to evaluation/faithfulness_results.jsonl;
re-running skips already-scored case ids, so a Groq free-tier 429 mid-run never
loses progress. Delete the .jsonl (or pass --fresh) to start over.

Run:  python evaluation/faithfulness_eval.py            (needs GROQ_API_KEY)
      python evaluation/faithfulness_eval.py --fresh    (ignore prior results)
Exit: 1 if mean faithfulness < THRESHOLD or any case errored (so it CAN be
      CI-wired later; it is NOT in the merge gate today).
